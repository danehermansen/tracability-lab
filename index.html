<div>This is Jeremy, you dont know him yet but he is coming for earth. He is known as the destroyer of worlds, he is the real live eqivalent of Galactus from Marvel. He may look friendly but he is going to swallow the earth in one gulp. Nothing compares to the size of Jeremy. Some speculate that he created the entire universe. He is allegedly the oldest being alive. He is so large that black holes cannot escape his pull. He may be from another universe, or he may be born from all of the rage of dogs across the universe from being tricked about going on a walk and then waking up with no manlihood. We may never know. Scientists have tried to distract Jeremy with balls, sticks and even sacrificing other planets to stop him. But he has one motive, universal destruction...<div/>
